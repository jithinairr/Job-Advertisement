    "#### Task 2 Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 2 focuses on creating feature representations for job advertisement descriptions. We generate count vectors based on Task 1's vocabulary and search meaningful data in word embeddings using language models. This gives us TF-IDF weighted and unweighted vectors, providing diverse ways to understand job ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 3 Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 3 shifts to job ad classification. We aim to classify ads into categories. Two key questions guide our exploration: 1) which language model from Task 2 performs best with our ML model, and 2) does including job titles improve accuracy? These questions drive our model-building and evaluation process."
